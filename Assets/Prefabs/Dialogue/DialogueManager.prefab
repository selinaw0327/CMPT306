  - "GHOST: Hello, little poor rookie! Welcome to hell! I was like you once, thrown
    down in this cave. I wasn\u2019t able to escape but I can help you get started.
    I wish you a better fate than the one I ended up with. "
  - 'ROOKIE: THANK YOU!'
  - 'GHOST: Use WASD or the Arrow Keys on your keyboard to move around the map. Careful!
    People here are not friendly. If you get too close to the other captives, they
    will attack you. '
  - "GHOST: Pressing \u2018I\u2019 on your keyboard or clicking on the backpack icon
    in the bottom-left will show or hide your inventory. "
  - "GHOST: To pick up items from the ground, simply walk by that item. That item
    will then be added to your inventory. If you ever want to drop an item, click
    on that item\u2019s inventory slot. "
  - "GHOST: You will need to find food and water to sustain your health. If your
    health drops to zero by either starving or being attacked, you\u2019ll end up
    like me. "
  - 'GHOST: You need to fend for yourself, fight off foes, forge your way out of
    this cave and survive. '
